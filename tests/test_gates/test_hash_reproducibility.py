"""Regression tests for https://github.com/Deltakit/deltakit/issues/354.

``Gate.__hash__`` and ``NoiseChannel.__hash__`` used to include the gate's
``self.__class__`` object in the hashed tuple. A class object's hash is
``object.__hash__``, which is based on the class's memory address. That
address is not fixed by ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` and differs between separate
Python processes, so any code that iterates a ``set``/``frozenset`` of gates
(for example when building a :class:`~deltakit_circuit.GateLayer` from a set
comprehension) produced a different iteration order in every process. That
nondeterministic order propagated through to the emitted Stim circuit: the
order of targets within a single Stim instruction, and the indices assigned
by :func:`~deltakit_circuit.default_qubit_mapping`, could both change from
run to run even though the logical circuit was unchanged.

``Qubit``/``Coordinate`` hashing was never part of the bug: both hash purely
on their value (``hash(self._unique_identifier)`` / ``tuple.__hash__``), so
the fix is scoped to gate and noise-channel hashing.

These tests spawn separate subprocesses (with a fixed ``PYTHONHASHSEED``) to
verify that emission is now reproducible across process boundaries, which an
in-process test cannot demonstrate since ``id()``-based hashes are stable for
the lifetime of a single process.
